ActiveSubdomainFinder is a Python script that helps you find active subdomains for a given target domain. You can either use the default wordlist provided in the repository or supply your own custom wordlist for the scan. The script checks each subdomain for activity by making HTTP requests and reports the results. Active subdomains are saved to a text file. It is useful for security testing and identifying live subdomains quickly.

To run the script:
python3 activesubdomain.py
